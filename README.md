## 🧩 About

This repo serves as my personal portfolio and study resource for DAA coursework and self-practice. Each program demonstrates a classical algorithm, focusing on clarity, correctness, and user interaction.

---

## 📚 Implemented Algorithms

- `quickselect.c` – Quickselect algorithm to find the k-th smallest element in an array
- `Ex1.c` to `Ex10.c` – Various exercises and algorithm implementations (details in code comments)
- [Add more as you implement new algorithms]

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC, clang)
- Basic command line knowledge

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WonderMystery05/Design-Analysis-and-Algorithm.git
cd Design-Analysis-and-Algorithm
```

## 🛠 How to Run

To compile and run an algorithm (using `quickselect.c` as an example):

```bash
gcc quickselect.c -o quickselect
./quickselect
```
- Follow the program prompts for input (array elements, k value, etc.)

---

## 📂 File Structure

- Each `.c` file = one algorithm or exercise.
- Code is commented for clarity; refer to code comments for algorithm details and example input/output.
